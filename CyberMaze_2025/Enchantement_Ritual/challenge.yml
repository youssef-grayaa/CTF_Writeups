    In every tale whispered across the old kingdoms, the hero’s journey begins the same way.
    Before facing dragons, shadow beasts, or whatever gonk-spawned horror lurks in forgotten ruins, the hero must seek an enchantment.
    But the artifact is unstable, its magic imperfect, its runes flawed.

    Those who understand its inner workings can reveal more than just enchanted words.
